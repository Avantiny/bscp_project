# bscp_project
I've created this project in April 2019 for a subject in school that focused on C++ programming.

It's a simple program used for overriding operators which enables using them on arrays of number. It also contains functions for ordering the arrays (asc/desc) and a function which fills the array with random numbers.
These operators are: +, -, *, /, +=, -=, == and !=.
